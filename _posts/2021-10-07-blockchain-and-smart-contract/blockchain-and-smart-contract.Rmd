## Blockchain v.s. Protocol v.s. Token  

Blockchain is a special (cryptographical blocks, chain, immutability, decentralization…) type of data structure or database implemented by a network of nodes who run on the same set of protocols (for example, Ethereum or Bitcoin or Neo etc.,). Its data entries are produced by nodes through a set of rules including consensus.    
On top of those protocols, the token can be generated by a specific type of smart contract which use the blockchain to record each account’s balance and transaction records. Token can be used to pay for network fees, smart contract deployments and in dApp purchases.   

## Smart Contract  

Smart contract is just a jargon of blockchain, essentially, it is a piece of code, and more specifically, it resembles the *class * concept in python and many other programming languages. The main compositions are **contract data** and **functions** (methods to manipulate the data in the contract).  

```{r,out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pic/contract.png")
```

Once the contract is deployed, it is stored in a place (an address) on blockchain. And other users of this smart contract could use (call) those functions, then the data inside the contract are impacted as a result.     

```{r,out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pic/deployment.png")
```
## What’s special about Blockchain

For applications (codes) running on a server, all clients (the front ends) are only sending requests then the codes are run on a central location (the server). So, the codes are stored and executed centrally.    
On the other hand, blockchain technology enables codes stored and run in every node of its network (decentralized, dApp—decentralized application) and what’s amazing is that blockchain technology can make all those nodes work in quantum entanglement style, which means once the data on blockchain is successfully modified by one node (by Pow, Pos etc), the data stored in other nodes will be updated to reflect the change also. The result will be that the same world state (all information in blockchain at one time) is shared by all nodes in the network of this blockchain.      
Since smart contract on blockchain is just code, it is information on blockchain by nature. Therefore, all users who call the functions of a smart contract are using and executing the same code, even thought most likely those users are running the code on different nodes.   

*Finally, if we let our imagination go wilder, we can put the law execution in smart contract to realize the idea of social covenant. What’s special about blockchain technology is that it enables the same rule applies to everyone, not only on concept but also on execution, since the terms will be automatically checked against and trigger the responsive punishment or reward.*
