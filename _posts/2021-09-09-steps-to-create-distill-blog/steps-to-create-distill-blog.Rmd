## 0. Clear Buzz-words first !

* **Distill** is a package in R to use **R Markdown** to creat professional-looking blogs. It takes care of all the html-webpage's construction, leaving us only need to focus on how to use Rmarkdown.  
* **Git** is a version control application which helps to track all the modifications of the blog posts.It is quite convenient if we directly use it in Rstudio.    
* **Github** is a cloud app of Git. *Commit*-in-Git, then *push*-to-Github are the successive steps each time we make change to the blog project.    
* **Netlify** is where we can share the blogs with the rest of the world. Each blog project will be assigned a site name in its own domain and most importantly it can connect with Github therefore seamlessly work with Github. _Once we deploy the blog project in Netlify for the first time, each time we make changes or creat new posts, we only need proceed Commit-Push (Git-Github), Netlify will automatically detect the change and update our web pages._

* After creating a distill blog project(*VLife*), the structure of the blog is automatically created, including a *index.Rmd*,a *about.Rmd* and a *welcome.Rmd* ,two folders(_posts, _site) as well as a yaml file(_site.yml)
