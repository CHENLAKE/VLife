### API Basics
*[APIs for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZvSYJDk-us&t=5753s)* 
```{r,out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/api_basics.jpg")
```

### POSTMAN 
*[Postman Beginner's Course - API Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywxIQ2ZXw4&t=3776s)*   
```{r,out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/postman.jpg")
```
1. **Query Parameter**   

> Query Parameter is used to filter what API returned, usually by pointing out the field’s value of returned json.

```{r,out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/query_param.jpg")
```   
2. **Tests tab**   

> If we want to check/test data of the returned Body, we could filter them in the **Tests** tab (won't change the returned Body, but filter in the "Tests" tab).

- 2.1. We can use **Console.log ()** to see the results of Tests,also can set the result of interest as a global variable for later requests.    

```{r,out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/Tests.jpg")
knitr::include_graphics("pics/global_var.jpg")
```   

>  One of the advantage of using POSTMAN `console.log()` is that the returned **Json** file can be viewed in a very clear manner, since the field and value are displayed in different colors.   

```{r,out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/Json_body.jpg")
``` 

- 2.2. **pm.test()**   
pm.test( “description string”, callback function-what to test ) is for postman to test the request response. 

```{r,out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/pmtest.jpg")
```   

- 2.3. jump a request   

```{r,out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/jump_request.jpg")
```      

- 2.4. stop   

```{r,out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/stop.jpg")
```       

### Postman OAuth2.0 authentication to use Google API   
> Using POSTMAN requires different authentication from using python code which uses Service Accounts and its json key, additional setups are needed to perform:   
1. Register POSTMAN as <mark>Authorised redirect URIs</mark> (web applications)      
2. Register postman as <mark>Authorised domains</mark>    
3. Add <mark>scope</mark> for specific API         

**Setup Steps :**       

1.	Go to Google Cloud Platform and sign in your Google account, select the Project you are in.   
2.	Go to **APIs & Services** and then to **Credentials** > **Create OAuth Client ID**

3.	Select **Web application** for Application type and enter either `https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/browser-callback`  or `https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback`  for Authorized redirect URLs. This ensures the auth flow works for Postman on both desktop and web. Once you hit **Create** you will see **Client ID** and **Client Secret** - those two values are important (do NOT share with anyone) and we will need them later in Postman.    

4.	Next go to **OAuth consent screen** and enter `oauth.pstmn.io` for **Authorised domains**. For **Scope**, and for **Google cloud API**, ` https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`    

```{r,out.width = "90%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/scope.jpg")
```     
<mark>5</mark>.	Go to postman, and edit the collection for the project. In **Authorization** tab > **Type**,  choose `oAuth 2.0`, the go down to **Configure New Token**, fill in the information and click **Get New Access Token**.      

- For “Auth URL”:  `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth   `
- For “Access Token URL”:  `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token   `
- For “Scope”:  `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform    `
 Then it will open up a web browser window asking for your authentication.

```{r,out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/auth_type.jpg")    
knitr::include_graphics("pics/configure.jpg")
```      

6.	Finally, token will be generated , as below. Those token may expire in some period, when it comes, just repeat the step **5** to get new token.      

```{r,out.width = "90%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/token.jpg")
```      

7.	When making request, just choose / inherit the Available Tokens.  

```{r,out.width = "90%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/req_token.jpg")
```

[ How to Guides ](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/how-to)     
[ Reference ](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/apis)

```{r,out.width = "41%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/reference.jpg")
```     

### Send a Google-DOC-AI Processing Request in POSTMAN  
*check [ official reference ](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/send-request)*     

```{r,out.width = "90%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/post_body.jpg")
```    

1. **HTTP method and URL:**    
```
POST 
https://LOCATION-documentai.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/processors/PROCESSOR_ID:process 
```   
2. **Body**:      
```json
{
  "skipHumanReview": true,
  "inlineDocument": {
    "mimeType": "application/pdf",
    "content": "{{f4}}"
  }
}
```      

  - `Human Review` means [Human In The Loop processor](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/hitl) which *enables human verification and corrections to ensure accuracy of data extracted by Human in the Loop processors before it is used in critical business applications. It provides a workflow and UI for humans (referred to as labelers in HITL) to review, validate and correct the data extracted from documents by Human in the Loop processors.*    
  - `mimiType` is talking about the **file formats** DOC AI supports:    
    `'application/pdf'` `,'application/json'`, `'image/tiff'`, `'image/gif'`.
  - `content` in POSTMAN we need pass **base64 encoding** (ASCII string) of binary image data into JSON representations. Google also has its [recommended ways](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/base64) to do it from which my code also borrowed the core.  
  
```{python, python.reticulate= FALSE,  eval=FALSE}
import base64
# Pass the image data to an encoding function.
def encode_image(image):
  image_content = image.read()
  return base64.b64encode(image_content)

f4 ="CI0000000041.pdf"
file_dir ="C:/V/Google AI doc/invoice_parser/"
PDF_PATH = file_dir + f1 # Update to path of target document
text_dir = file_dir +'base64.txt'
# encode
with open(PDF_PATH, "rb") as image:
    content = encode_image(image)
# get content and use it in POSTMAN
with open(text_dir,"wb") as f:
    f.write(content)
  
```             
> A good way to adduce the content(`{{f4}}`) is to save it as a **global variable**     

```{r,out.width = "90%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/base64.jpg")
