  There are 3 scopes of knowledge involved in delivering a piece of  Data Visualization task :1.	Data Analytical knowledge --- understand the power of data ( statistics, data transformation, machine learning models etc); 2.	Data Visualization knowledge --- use apt charts /graphs to tell the story you want.3.	Tools related knowledge --- choose a media to formalize the work ( pencil & paper, excel, Power BI, Tableau etc. ).Today, I am discussing the 3rd scope, more specifically, Power BI.
