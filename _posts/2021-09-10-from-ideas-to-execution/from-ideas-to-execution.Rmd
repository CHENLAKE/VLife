## 1. A Bad Experience  

A few years ago, I had this exhausted experience in making changes in a small real estate development company. At the beginning as a member of senior management, the initiative to deploy new strategy for the project and company was all exciting since the plan/ vision/ ideas from board was quite appealing, not only to senior managers, but also to government and medias. Why? Because those ideas are “creative”, new technology employing, sound future-oriented and promising. But the reality is those ideas never realize. 

When it comes to internal execution and deliveries, that hot passion met with cold reaction from employees. In our eyes, most of them were unwilling to accept new ideas, slow to changes, not responsive to the use of new tools… But in their eyes (this is the retrospective view), senior managers came up with new ideas everyday and enjoyed the luxury of freeing their imagination and widening their vision. 

In staffs’ eyes, top managers were good at pointing out the destination for a ship in the ocean but left the crews to figure out how to get there. However, there are infinite number of paths possible to lead to that destination and before an executable plan forms, the first reaction staffs would take usually is to wait and maintain the status quo ---以不变应万变 in Chinese. In managers’ eyes, this is the signature of being slow or even reluctant to change. But what are they waiting for? For things/ tasks become clearer. 

### 1.1 Who’s to blame?   

I can’t blame each side. Can’t blame the top managements for having too many ideas, since that is their job and value. 

Neither can I blame the employees, since when they signed employment contract, they were agreed to serve specific roles with specific skills (most likely there was no itemized job requirement for being-adaptable-to-change, since no one would in advance know what is going to change in the future and what to adapt to ? )and they normally do well in completing a clearly defined task.

To V, there is a gap need to be filled. A gap between manager’s innovative (but sometimes inevitably  vague) idea and an executable path/ plan for staffs to carry out professionally. 

Therefore, a middleware / middleman is needed, to have the talent and responsibility of drawing out the path, leaving the employees focusing on their own fields and tasks only. 

## 2. A surprisingly effortless but successful project experience 

During master program, for almost each course we took, we were asked to form a team and a problem that need to be solved, then use the skill and knowledge learnt in class to form a detailed plan even model to solve it.  (Great program, thanks to Singapore Management University)

Those projects were not easy though, since I didn’t know  those team members  before ,unaware of their mindsets and capabilities. Most of the time, I felt I was trying my best but still couldn’t get a great result/ project performance.  

I tried to force myself to accept the notion  that teamwork won't be easy, until I finished a data analytic project with one classmate and got it accepted by *JMP Discovery Summit Americas 2021*. The most unbelievable part is that that is the most comfortable and effortless project for me till now, but it achieves the best result! (*easy* doesn’t mean the project has no intellectual value, e*ffortless *doesn’t mean we succeeded due to luck)

### 2.1 Why least effort but most effective?   

Upon completion of that project in May 2021, I couldn’t help giving gratitude to Yongkai (my teammate) since I felt that I didn’t
"**do**" the work much (e.g.,run the model or write report) but contribute ideas and discussions along the way (e.g.,frame problem statement, discuss the approach to tackle the problem, raise questions on his analysis, read the final report and give feedback )

Surprisingly, Yongkai conveyed his thanks to me for all my ideas and questions raised in the project. He said he is the kind of person good at effective execution  but he needs clear directions, once he knows what to do next, he could be very efficient to deliver. He said because his energy focused on finding solutions for the problems occurring during **doing**, he was not good at **thinking** out of the box or **thinking** differently. 

All in all, it turns out the best outcome comes not from "*hard*" work but from the coincidence that our **thinking habits** fit each other’s perfectly, the fact that we only need to contribute in what we are good at made everyone's work  effortless but fruitful. 

### 2.2 Key takeaways from this experience   

* Everyone has his/her own way of thinking formed by his or her entire life. If possible, matching team with complementary [Thinking Style](https://en-gb.emergenetics.com/apac/), for example,   
  + **Conceptual** ：Visionary/ Intuitive about ideas/ Enjoys the unusual/ Learns by experimenting   
  + **Procedural** : Likes guidelines/ Predictable/ Cautious of new ideas/ Learns by doing   

* There is no better or worse thinking style, since any work needs both thinking and doing. The fact that in general we are comfortable and proficient at *only one* style,we need appreciate each other to be able to deliver a piece of fine work..  


## 3. What about the ability to change  
 
In a fast-pacing ever-changing business world, many believe it is paramount to have the ability to change. Again, sounds appealingly correct, but think deeply, who is the subject here? 

Imagine a ship confronting a capricious ocean, who needs the ability to be adaptive-to-change? The crew members on the ship? Or The captain?  Neither. It is the ship that needs to be able to change swiftly. Each staff on the contrary, needs specialize in their own task.   

> This is the power of **system** behavior (to put it simply, 1+1 > 2).  
Each water molecule in the ocean needs to perform the function no more than what a H2O molecule can do. It is the **system** that forms the totally disparate existence – the ocean.
