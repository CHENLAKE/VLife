title: "Sharpen Jupyter Notebook"
description: |
  An artisan must sharpen her tools before she is to do the work not only well but also blissfully. Jupyter notebook is a powerful tool to learn python coding(local machine) as well as data science, AI(colab on cloud). Python course I took from university only covered python per se which was a bit of pity.

## What is Jupyter Notebook ?

*These are not official definition of JN, but some personal understandings which helped me in learning and working*

1. **web-based** computational environment for creating notebook documents (formally `ipython` notebook, that's why its extension is `.ipynb`. Btw, the name jupyter is said to refer to 3 languages: Ju = `Julia`, Pyt = `Python`, the 3rd is `R` ).    
2. a notebook is a **JSON** document( you can see it if you use any other python editor such as Spyder to open `.ipynb` file).   
3. Jupyter **Kernel** is the program handling the relevant requests and response.     

```{r,out.width = "60%", fig.align = "left", fig.cap ="Kernel -Python 3 ", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/kernel.png")
```       
4. codes or texts are written inside **Cell** of which there are 2 types: `Code`, `Markdown`. If you click any cell, the type will be shown here.   

```{r, fig.align = "left", fig.cap ="Cell Type ", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/cell_type.png")
```    

5. by Python kernel, a notebook is run together with a python instance, which maintains all the variables and functions ever executed in code cells within a notebook, **even after the cell is deleted**.     

```{python, python.reticulate =FALSE,echo=TRUE,  eval=FALSE}
dir()
``` 
6. notebook will only care about the **sequence of execution** rather than the sequence a cell is positioned ( e.g.,insertion ).
