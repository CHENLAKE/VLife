title: "Bitcoin Malleability Attack"
description: |
  Malleability is the property of some cryptographic algorithms which generate different but valid digital signatures for the same message. Under normal situation, it does no harm to it's objective of verifying that the message signed is not tampered with by anyone else. However, it caused some trouble in Bitcoin.
